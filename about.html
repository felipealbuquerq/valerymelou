    <div class="st-Section_Intro">I'm a web developer who enjoys using web technologies to build everything from small websites to highly interactive apps for web, mobile and desktop. I'm passionate, talented and always ready for a good challenge.</div>

        <h3 class="st-Section_Subtitle">What I do</h3>
        <p>My specialty is full-stack web development: crafting RESTFull APIs with <a href="http://djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a> and consuming them with <a href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a>. I have also worked with <a href="https://symfony.com">Symfony</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a>. With any of these frameworks, I'm used to always deliver clean and maintainable test-driven code in Python, JavaScript or PHP. When they are ready for production, I often turn my web apps into native mobile or desktop apps using tools like <a href="https://inoicframework.com" target="_blank">Ionic</a> and <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron</a>.</p>
        <p>I also love to design and craft good looking websites from scratch with only HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript (as I did for this one you are browsing). But for larger projects I know how take advantage of the power of libraries like <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> and <a href="https://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress</a> to deliver powerful and customizable solutions to my clients.</p>

        <h3 class="st-Section_Subtitle">Tools I use</h3>
        <p>As a web dev, I use so many tools in my daily tasks but, those I can't go by without are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>: All the coding happens here.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a>: To check if everything works as expected.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Git</strong>: To track all the changes to my code.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 class="st-Section_Subtitle">My interests</h3>
        <p>I like to have deep conversations about tech with everyone. You can ping me on any of my social accounts if you are interested. I'll be happy to chat with you.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading a book, catching a movie, listening good music, walking around the city or just spending some quality time with friends and family.</p>
